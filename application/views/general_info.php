                    <p class='text'>The ‘Clinical Problems and Conditions’ list has been developed as a resource to help students keep track of their clinical learning. It is an adaptation (with kind permission) of original material developed and published by Dr Henry Mandin. We are grateful for permission to use his earlier work.</p>

                    <strong class='text bold'>About the Problem List</strong><br />
                    <p class='text'>The list is composed of <span class='text bold'>‘Clinical problems’</span> with which patients may present. Each Clinical problem is associated with a list of possible <span class='text bold'>‘conditions’</span> that may cause it.</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>Conditions are further divided into <span class='text bold'>‘core conditions’</span> – those which are more common or important; and <span class='text bold'>'non-core conditions'</span>, which are less so, but nevertheless important to be aware of.</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>There are separate lists for Clinical problems and conditions for adults and children. It has recently been updated and is now (November 2012) ready for use.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class='text bold'>How to use the list</strong><br />
                    <p class='text'>We think there are 2 main ways to use the list, though you will doubtless find others:</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>1. As a tool to guide reading around problems seen, focusing more (though not exclusively) on the core conditions – ‘what should I read about having seen this clinical problem?’</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>2. As a  ‘map’ to review  how one’s learning is progressing – ‘which of these problems have I seen or learned about and which do  I need to address to cover the gaps?’</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class='text bold'>Some comments about the list</strong>
                    <p class='text'>1. It is worth reviewing the full list of problems to develop an idea of how the list looks overall.</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>2. Some of the ‘Clinical problems’ are not really things that a patient would bring to a doctor, e.g. ‘abnormal biochemistry’. Some editorial licence has been needed to include categories such as these, but they follow the principle that such problems do come to a clinician’s attention and have associated conditions as their cause.</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>3. ‘Pain’ is difficult to categorise. We have taken a decision to label most pains by the location where they are experienced. A few are grouped together under ‘Regional pain’.</p><br />
                    <p class='text'>4. In a list of this length, there are bound to be inconsistencies. Please feel free to feed them back, but also to allow some editorial control. Please send any comments to: <a href="mailto:gpsiftadmin@medschl.cam.ac.uk">gpsiftadmin@medschl.cam.ac.uk</a>. We will take them into account when developing a future edition.</p>

                    <p class='text'>The list has been reviewed by a wide range of local clinicians from a range of specialties to minimise errors and maximise its relevance for day to day practice. Each attachment in the clinical course has rated how likely you are to come across each <span class="bold">clinical problem</span> in that part of the course.</p><br />

                    <p class='text'>Note that the colour rating applies to the Clinical Problem, not necessarily to all of the conditions associated with it. Currently, these ratings are estimates, but the rating can be used to help focus learning as you progress through the course. Note that Medicine and General Practice have rated the clinical problems relating to their attachments across the entire Clinical course. Each adult clinical problem is rated green or blue somewhere in the course. Some childrens’ clinical problems are not, reflecting the lower prevalence of disease amongst children.</p>
