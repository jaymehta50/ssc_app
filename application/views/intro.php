                    <p class="text">
                        Firstly - you can access the menu for this app by clicking on the Menu icon (<span class="icon menu"></span>) in the top-left of this page.
                    </p><br />
                    <p class="text">
                        From this menu you can choose between looking at the Problem List, your Own Notes or General Info about the Clinical Problems and Conditions list.
                    </p><br />
                    <p class="text">
                        Clicking on "List of Clinical Problems" will show you all of the major problems in the Problem List (sub-divided into 3 pages - use the links at the bottom!). From here you can click on any problem to see how it is subdivided into subgroups, and clicking on a subgroup will show the conditions associated with that problem.
                    </p><br />
                    <p class="text">
                        You can then click on any condition, which will show you when in the course you are likely to see a patient presenting with this condition. You will also be able to add your own notes to that condition, and review any previously made notes.
